Howdy! 👋
This is where a description would go for things like the databases we use, resources, and other things we need to cite, ie...

### Resources:
* Database for Accredited Institutions from DAPIP: https://ope.ed.gov/dapip/#/download-data-files
* Database from IPEDS (viewable in browser with filters!): https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data#SurveyData
* Database for HBCUs: https://hbcuconnect.com/colleges/?sort=0

### Coder Area
Using Git functionality will ensure that we'll all be on the same page!
